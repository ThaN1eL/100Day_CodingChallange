# 📚 100 Days of Coding Challenge 

Welcome to my **#100DaysofCode** challenge repository! This is where I documented my daily coding journey as I tackle Python programming concepts, solve problems, and build small projects every day for 100 days straight.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

Each day brings new Challenge adventures! Here's a taste of what you'll find:
1. Mastering Fundamental Problem Solving using **Python** as my core
2. Gradually expand projects to **Front End Web Development** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React)
3. Build **REST APIs** and others backend systems
4. Explore **Docker** and others
All done step-by-step, one commit at a time for 100 days straight.

I'm undertaking this challenge to:
- Build consistent coding habits
- Strengthen my **Skills**
- Create a portfolio of small projects
- Prepare for more advanced programming concepts
